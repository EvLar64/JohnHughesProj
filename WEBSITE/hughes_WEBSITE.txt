(John Hughes picture)

Lower Blurb: “John Hughes (1950 - 2009) was one of the most influential filmmakers of the 1980’s, 
             with many of his works still standing the test of time. This project is focused on 
             analyzing the screenplays for three of his most famous movies: Sixteen Candles (1984), 
             The Breakfast Club (1985), and Ferris Bueller’s Day Off (1986). We are interested in 
             seeing how the scripts hold up after nearly forty years, while also extracting certain 
             data from them (including things like word tracking, dialogue frequencies, and various 
             comparisons between the three). Each screenplay’s original .txt source file can be found in the links below.

            (Embed the three links below into labels that are just the movie’s titles, same order as listed above.)

2.) 

Should just be the three html output pages of each script (Nav bars will have to be added to connect all the pages together)

3.) 

Just a simple one of those “code block” views that shows the schema (similar to how the original .txt files were in there)

 * Underneath the schema throw in two photos next to each other (set photos of any of the movies) and give them brief captions *

4.) 

(Data will be made, collected, and sent in repo later for easy addition to the site, but just for layout purposes: )

Screenplay Data: 
- Sixteen Candles Average Scene Length
- BC Average Scene Length
- FB Average Scene Length
- SC Average Dialogue Length
- BC Average Dialogue Length
- FB Average Dialogue Length
- [MADE] SC Number of Locations
- [MADE] BC Number of Locations
- [MADE] FB Number of Locations
- Frequencies of Character Mentions

 * Underneath Screenplay Data, two more photos of the movies and/or set photos (w/ brief captions) *

Word Data: 
- [MADE] Concordance examples of different words for each movie
- [MADE] Lexical Richness of all three scripts
- [MADE] 20 instances of "unique" words in EACH script (excluding script words like CUT TO or CONTINUED, etc.)
- [MADE] 10 Most Common Verbs, Adjectives, and Prepositions within each script

- “Code View” of PYTHON DATA FILE 1 showing all of these different processes (will be consolidated and shared to repo)

  * Underneath code view of python, two more photos (w/ brief captions) *

5.) 

- [MADE x 3] Pie Chart Comparing number of INT vs EXT locations in all three movies 
- [MADE] Frequency of character mentions in Breakfast Club bar graph
- [MADE] Visual depicting how many of Ferris’ lines are directed to the camera (or perhaps a “timeline’ with dots showing all the times where he does)
- [MADE x 3] Bar Graphs showing frequencies of different parts of speech (verb, adjective, preposition) for all three movies
- Production Budget vs. Gross Graph (one graph showing both for all movies; double bar graph/circles)
- Lexical Dispersion Plots of “80s words” for each movie (phrase, word ideas?)

- Underneath the graphs, ANOTHER “code view” of PYTHON DATA FILE 2 that will display all of these visualization functions.

 * Two more photos underneath code view of Visualization python file (PYTHON DATA FILE 2) *

6.)

- Network of all parenthetical descriptors and the movie(s) or characters they connect to (<desc> elements in xml)

7.)

- Team member blurbs (later)

8.)

- Just links to project repo
