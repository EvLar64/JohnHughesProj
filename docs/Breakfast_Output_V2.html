               60062.  Dear Mr. Vernon...we accept
               the fact that we had to sacrifice a
               whole Saturday in detention for
               whatever it was that we did wrong,
               what we did was wrong.  But we think
               you're crazy to make us write this
               essay telling you who we think we
               are, what do you care?  You see us
               as you want to see us...in the
               simplest terms and the most
               convenient definitions.  You see us
               as a brain, an athelete, a basket
               case, a princess and a criminal.
               Correct?  That's the way we saw each
               other at seven o'clock this morning.
               We were brainwashed...</p>

               fat people.  There's fat people that
               were born to be fat, and then there's
               fat people that were once thin but
               they became fat...so when you look
               at them you can sorta see that thin
               person inside!  You see, you're
               gonna get married, you're gonna
               squeeze out a few puppies and then,

               Um, I'm here today...because uh,
               because my coach and my father don't
               want me to blow my ride.  See I get
               treated differently because uh,
               Coach thinks I'm a winner.  So does
               my old man.  I'm not a winner
               because I wanna be one... I'm a
               winner because I got strength and
               speed.  Kinda like a race horse.
               That's about how involved I am in
               what's happening to me.</p>

               And the bizarre thing is, is that
               I did it for my old man...I
               tortured this poor kid, because I
               wanted him to think that I was cool.
               He's always going off about, you
               know, when he was in school...all
               the wild things he used to do.  And
               I got the feeling that he was
               disappointed that I never cut loose
               on anyone, right...So, I'm...I'm
               sitting in the locker room, and I'm
               taping up my knee.  And Larry's
               undressing a couple lockers down
               from me.  Yeah...he's kinda...
               he's kinda skinny, weak.  And I
               started thinking about my father,
               and his attitude about weakness.
               And the next thing I knew, I uh, I
               jumped on top of him and started
               wailing on him...And my friends,
               they just laughed and cheered me on.
               And afterwards, when I was sittin'
               in Vernon's office, all I could
               think about was Larry's father. And
               Larry havin' to go home and...and
               explain what happened to him.  And
               the humiliation...fucking
               humiliation he mustuv felt.  It
               mustuv been unreal...I mean,
               (he's crying)
               I mean, how do you apologize for
               something like that?  There's no
               way...it's all because of me and
               my old man.  Oh God, I fucking hate
               him!  He's like this...he's like
               this mindless machine that I can't
               even relate to anymore..."Andrew,
               you've got to be number one!  I
               won't tolerate any losers in this
               family...Your intensity is for shit!
               Win.  Win!  WIN!!!"  You son of a
               bitch!  You know, sometimes, I wish
               my knee would give...and I wouldn't
               be able to wrestle anymore.  And he
               could forget all about me...</p>

               walking up to you in the hall on

               picture this, you're there with all

               you'd do, you'd say hi to him and
               when he left you'd cut him all up
               so your friends wouldn't think you
               really liked him!</p>

               No!  'Cause you know how shitty that

            <p class="dialogue">CLAIRE
               Okay, what about you, you hypocrite!
               Why don't you take Allison to one of

               take Brian out to the parking lot at
               lunch to get high?  What about Andy
               for that matter, what about me?
               What would your friends say if we
               were walking down the hall together.
               They'd laugh their asses off and
               you'd probably tell them you were
               doing it with me so they'd forgive

               friends and you certainly wouldn't
               condescend to speak to any of my

               you can forget it!  'Cause it's never
