        <p>This project is about analyzing three different scripts for John Hughes films (The Breakfast Club, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Sixteen Candles) using regex primarily.
            We are interested in seeing how the scripts hold up after nearly fourty years, specifically through the average length of scenes, the amount of dialogue between chraracters, and
            how the dialogue compares to how we speak currently.
            We have three text files, one for each of the three scripts that we will be working with.</p>
