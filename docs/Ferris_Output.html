               I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others,
               right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station.
               His father's dead and his sister's rumored
               to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit.
               She only puts out so people will hang out
               with her. It's sad but I don't hold it
               against her. Better to hold it against the
               guys who use her and don't care about her.
               (pause)
               My parents never allowed Garth over here.
               It was because of his family. Mainly his
               older brother. He's in jail. I could see them
               not wanting his brother here because he is
               a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here.
               I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of
               artificial fruit just so he could see what
               it was like to have his stomach pumped.
               But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault
               that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights
               with the parents on that point. I always felt
               for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once
               and I was laying on the dark worrying that
               his brother was going to come in and hack me
               to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying.
               I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing".
               ... Nothing was wrong. There was no
               specific thing he was crying about.
               In fact, he wasn't really even aware that
               he was crying. He just cried himself to
               sleep every night. It was a habit. The
               guy's so conditioned to grief that if
               he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How
               could you possibly dump on guy who has to
               deal with that kinda shit? My parents
               acknowledge the trudge of the situation
               and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel
               for him but still the guy's banned from

               Unfortunately, now my parents have a

               getting one on his own. He's lost. It's
               over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from

               I used to think that my family was
               the only one that had weirdness
               in it. It used to worry me. Then I
               met Cameron and I saw how his
               family functioned.</p>

               Cameron's home life is really shit.
               He wasn't lying. That's why he's sick
               all the time. It really upsets him.
               What he said about his parents hating
               each other? I refuse to sleep over at
               his house. His parents fight all the
               time. Even when I'm there. Is there
               anything worse than being at somebody's
               house when their parents are fighting?
               It's the absolute height of social
               discomfort.</p>
            <p class="narration">He checks his hair in the mirror.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">FERRIS
               When they go after each other, Cameron
               tightens up. It's scary. He gets so
               wadded-up, you couldn't pry his buns
               apart with a crowbar. The thing with
               taking his old man's car? It's good
               for him. It teaches him to deal with
               his fear. Plus, and I must
               be honest here, I love driving it.
               I highly recommend picking one up.</p>
            <p class="narration">He exists the men's room. We hold a beat. A toilet flushes. Another beat and Tom walks
               out of the stall. He crosses to the sink.</p>

               But that's not true. I'm a romantic.
               I think alot of people my age are.
               We think about love and matters of

               as my sweetheart. Act one was when we
               met. I loved you at first glance. You
               read your lines so cleverly and never
               missed a cue. Then came act two. You
               seemed to change. You acted strange.

               I'm going to tell a massive lie here.
               It's going to by very thick and very
               steamy. I think radio's a facinating
               medium, it challenges the imagination.
               Unlike television which provides the
               images, radio...
               (pause)
               You know this. Anyway, it's always been
               a dream of mine to be on the radio.
               I have what I consider to be an excellent
               broadcast voice. I practise it in the
               bathroom all the time. I used to play
               records and do introductions to them.
               But I've never had the chance to sit
               behind a microphone and try it out
               for real. This is a 50,000 watt outlet.
               I'm going out to several million people
               so let me just say, I'm in a very pleasant
               groove right now.

               Jersey State Police but I thought I
               might get busted. After I got flunked
               in driver's ed for sideswiping a mail
               box, which was not in any way, shape
               or from my fault. I was putting out a
               cigarette, like I was told. It was weird.
               I'm so used to getting in a car and
               lighting up, because I'm not allowed to
               smoke at home, that I got in the driver's
               ed. car and spaced completely, pulled out
               of the lot, lit up a 'boro and Mrs. Heller
               looked at me like I'd just pulled a bunny
               out of my nose or something and I realized
               what the hell I was doing and I went to
               put it out and hit the mail box. Anyway,
               I was so pissed off at her reaction to
               the whole thing that I considered running
               an ad in a sleaze magazine for a school
               teacher that does phone sex and I was gonna
               use Mrs. Heller's home number but is cost
               too much. I took it again and passed. But
               I had to work at Burger King to get the
               cash to pay for the driver's ed. car. The
               car got fixed in auto shop for nothing and
               I think Rooney pocketed the cash. But I

               Cameron's never been in love. At
               least no one's ever been in love
               with him. He's gonna marry the first
               girl he lays. And she's gonna treat
               him like shit because he's gonna
               kiss her ass for giving him what he's
               built-up in his mind as the end-all,
               be-all of human existance. She won't
               respect him because you can't respect
               someone who kisses your ass. It just
               doesn't work.</p>

               Conventional wisdom would suggest
               a visit to the nearest trauma
               center. I wouldn't fault anybody
               for doing that. My, personally,
