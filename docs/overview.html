          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <hr/>
        <h3>Methods</h3>
          <p>For this project, we began by gathering different .txt files of the scripts for The Breakfast Club, Suxteen Candles, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. 
          We each took one screenplay and analyzed it for different data, including: number of character mentions, the number of interior and exterior scenes, shot descriptions, etc.
          There was one schema that we all took part in editing in order to read each of the three screenplays. For our data, we all created SVG files to help visually determine our findings for each film.
          The SVG files went hand-in-hand with the data, and also analyzed more things such as production budget, box office earnings, etc.
          Finally, we created one Cytoscape network for all three screenplays to help determine the dialogue descriptions often associated with the characters in each individual film.</p>
          <h3>Issues</h3>
        <p>We ran into several issues when working on this project, but they were resolved with relative ease. All three screenplays were accessible on the internet. 
         However, some of the Sixteen Candles screenplay had to be remarked up early on. The screenplays also had different camera directions and scene headings which was difficult at first.
         On our Github repo, we had a consistent issue with getting the .DS_Store file to stay permanently gone. Some of the SVG files were redone early on as well in order to make them more comprehensible.
         We had to redo our .tsv file for the Cytoscape network a few times until it was able to be read and understood. We also had difficulty getting the Cytoscape network up on the site, though that was later fixed.</p>
