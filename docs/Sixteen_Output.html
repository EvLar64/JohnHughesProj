            <p class="narration">A quiet, upper-middle class, North Shore Chicago suburb. A Chevy Blazer cruises slowly
               down the street. Morning papers are pitched out the window. A dog runs between the
               houses. It's early autumn.</p>

            <p class="narration">The alarm continues for a beat. It stops and the house explodes with activity as the
               Baker family wakes and scrambles about their morning activities. There's Jim Baker,
               midforties, father, insurance executive, tall, lean, somewhat meek-looking, in his
               suit pants and handlebar undershirt scurrying to the bathroom.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               Let's go! Chop, chop! We've got
               relatives invading this afternoon!</p>
            <p class="narration">He slams the bathroom door. His wife, Brenda, whips out of the bedroom in her housecoat
               and heads down the stairs. She's also in her midforties, strong, attractive and dominant.
               Mike Baker, ten, wanders out of his bedroom, scratching his rear end, yawning. He's
               young trouble, preteen maniac boy.</p>
            <p class="dialogue"> BRENDA
               (as she descends)

               wedding tomorrow. Why can't you
               cooperate?</p>
            <p class="narration">Ginny Baker, twenty-one, comes out of her room in panties and a sweatshirt. She's
               very pretty, very pampered and very sloppy. She slips past Jim as he scolds Mike,
               goes into the bathroom and locks the door. Sara turns and marches into the bathroom
               at the other end of the hall.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">MIKE
               Dad, I didn't hit her. I'd like to
               very much and I probably will later,
               but give me a bi:eak, you know my
               method. I don't hit her when you're
               just down the hall.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               Pick on somebody your own size.</p>
            <p class="narration">He turns back to the bathroom.</p>
            <p class="narration">MIKE AND SARA She gives Mike a smug, snotty face. He squints angrily.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">MIKE

               sunlight shines down through a skylight above the brass bed. The sheets and blankets
               are rumpled and kicked aside. Samantha Baker stands before a floor mirror in the corner
               of the room. Her back is to camera. A bath towel is wrapped around her waist. She's
               staring at her body in the mirror. She was up long before anyone else in the house
               and has already showered. She puts a hand on her hip and strikes a pose. She doesn't
               like it. She tries the other hand. Both hands. She cocks her hip. Finally, she raises
               both arms and strikes a Charles Atlas pose. She holds it for a moment, then drops
               her arms. She groans.</p>

               Don't be cute. I'm so paranoid. I
               know everybody'd be happier if I was
               marrying a white bread. Aunt Grace
               pulled me aside at the luncheon and
               told me that every family like Rudy's,
               no matter how straight, has a thug
               in it. She said it would be impos-
               sible to divorce him and live to
               enjoy it.</p>

               I really love Rudy. And he loves me
               totally. I've had guys who loved
               me, but Rudy is like flipped-out.
               Even after six months.</p>
            <p class="narration">Ginny's casual attitude toward romance reminds Sam of how romantically bankrupt her
               own life is. Ginny has long enjoyed an overabundance of boyfriends. She has no consideration
               of how Sam might feel.</p>

               That's really sweet, Sam, but Rudy
               and my love isn't a going steady
               thing. It's mature, adult love.
               We're getting married. This is it.
               The big time. When your turn comes
               around, you'll understand what I'm
               saying.</p>

               bust in the mirror on the back of the door. She drops the subject. Sam stands behind
               her and checks herself in the mirror.</p>

               This was awhile ago, I combed my
               hair different, I was young and fit
               and I didn't walk around the house in
               my undershorts. I was in college and
               I was head over heels in love with
               this girl.</p>

            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               Anyway, she wouldn't even look at me.
               So I knew that if anything was going
               to happen, I'd have to make the first
               move.</p>

               Either could I. But after worrying
               about it for a couple of weeks, I
               finally got up the courage to go to
               the sorority house where she lived.
               I let her know I wanted to see her
               and she came down. I wanted to
               faint. She walked over to me and ....</p>
            <p class="dialogue">SAM
               I think I know how this ends, Dad
               She turned out to be and you

               (shakes his

               No. She stomped on my foot so hard,
               she broke two toes. I met your mom
               at the hospital.</p>
            <p class="narration">There's a pause as both Jim and Sam realize that his story has no relevance to Sam's

            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               I guess that doesn't help you much,

            <p class="dialogue">SAM
               Not really.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               Yeah. Well, if it's any consolation,
               I love you and if this guy can't see
               in you all the beautiful, wonderful
               things I see, he's got the problem.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">SAM
               It just hurts.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               That's why they call them crushes. If
               they were easy, they'd call them some-

            <p class="dialogue">SAM
               If I were Ginny, I'd have this guy

            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               Let me tell you something about Ginny.
               I love her just as much as I love you.
               But she's a different person. I'm a
               little worried about her. When things
               come easy, you don't always appreciate
               them. You, I'm not worried. When it
               happens to you, Samantha, it'll be
               forever.</p>
            <p class="narration">He leans over and kisses her forehead. He draws her close and hugs her. She kisses
               him and holds him as tight as he holds her.</p>
            <p class="dialogue">JIM
               I won't be able to sleep unless I
               know I helped you out with this
               little talk, so would you be a sport
               and lie to me?</p>

            <p class="narration">Jim gives her a squeeze and a kiss on the forehead. He gets up and crosses to the
